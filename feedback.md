# Feedback

Really, really nice job on this project. It has an awesome interface and is a very creative twist on your standard hangman! I left a bunch of comments/suggestions in your files on where you can clean things up, but overall you did a really great job with organizing your code. Watch how many ids and classes you're assigning in your html - try to use classes for styles and ids only if it's needed with js.
